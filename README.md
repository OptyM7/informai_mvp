Informai Investigation Project

The Informai Investigation Project simply investigates the use of small LLM model (around 125M â€“ 250M parameters) finetuned to fulfill specific form filling scenarios. The appeal of a narrow AI approach to specific form filling scenarios, is that hardware, training and inference costs associated of the LLM, are greatly reduced. 

The scope of this project only covers an attempt in finetuning the GPT-Neo 125M model for the scenario of filling blood test request forms. 

Test data was generated from the larger GPT-4o-mini model, and 2000 instances of blood test request form questions were used to train the model.
