He does not possess a veteran affairs card or a Repat Gold card. Since he prefers concession billing, I will ensure that the payment process is managed accordingly. The results will be sent to his mobile number or home address if he requests a follow-up. \n\nThe results will not be needed urgently, and no need for phone or fax results has been established. The requesting doctor's details include Doctor Jake Taylor, whose doctor number is 987654, and he practices at Springfield Medical Centre, 12 Health Drive, Springfield.
